  Abstract. Traditional retirement - full withdrawal from labor market - has increasingly shifted toward “un-retirement,” with many seniors returning to work after claiming Social Security benefits. This study introduces “precautionary retirement,” where seniors remain employed due to inadequate savings, limited insurance, and rising health-related expenses. Empirically, senior labor participation doubled since 1990, affected by wealth difference: the wealthy retirees show high labor supply due to increased medical expense risks. Our theoretical model explicitly links retirement timing to Social Security benefit claims, highlighting how increased medical expense risk delays retirement timing. Eliminating out-of-pocket medical expense risks after retirement decreases the average life-cycle working hours by 33%.

  Abstract. This paper investigates how ambiguity aversion affects fertility decisions, considering the uncertainty surrounding the benefits of parenthood. We extend the Becker and Barro (1988) fertility model by incorporating ambiguity aversion to capture parents’ decision-making process accurately. We assume that individuals care about their own and children’s well-being (dynastic altruism) and face ambiguity about their children’s future abilities (ambiguity aversion). Using a multiple priors utility framework, we model parents’ preferences as maximizing their minimum expected utility of descendants, focusing on the worst-case scenario for their child’s ability. Our findings suggest that more ambiguity-averse parents tend to have fewer children, as they emphasize the lowest possible outcome. This insight helps explain declining fertility rates and rising childlessness in developed countries, as individuals prioritize predictable outcomes over uncertain returns of parenthood.
