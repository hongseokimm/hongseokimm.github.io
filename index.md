<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Biography</h2>

<p style="font-size:1.2em;">
I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in Economics at [Iowa State University](https://www.econ.iastate.edu/). Before Ph.D., I obtained my bachelor's and master's degree from [Hanyang University](https://www.hanyang.ac.kr), Seoul, South Korea. 
<br>
My research lies at the intersection of **macroeconomics** with a focus on understanding the macroeconomic implications of **demographic transitions**, including fertility and retirement decisions. 
<br>
I will be on the academic job market in **2025-2026**. My C.V is available [here](assets/files/HongSeok_CV_Latest.pdf).
