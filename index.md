<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Biography</h2>

I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Economics at [Iowa State University](https://www.econ.iastate.edu/). Before Ph.D., I obtained my bachelor's and master's degree from [Hanyang University](https://www.hanyang.ac.kr), Seoul, South Korea. 

My research lies at the intersection of **macroeconomics** -- with a focus on understanding the underlying mechanisms for **fertility decisions** and the macroeconomic implications of **population dynamics**.
